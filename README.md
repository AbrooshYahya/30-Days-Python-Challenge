# üêç 30-Day Python Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day Python challenge! This repository documents my journey to level up my Python skills by tackling a new coding problem or concept every day for 30 consecutive days.

This challenge is all about consistent learning and practical application. Each day, I'll push new code covering a different topic, ranging from fundamental data structures to more advanced topics like automation, web scraping, and data analysis.

## üöÄ Goals of this Challenge

* **Consistency:** Build a habit of daily coding.
* **Skill Development:** Deepen my understanding of core Python concepts and explore new libraries and frameworks.
* **Problem-Solving:** Improve my algorithmic thinking by solving a variety of problems.
* **Portfolio Building:** Create a public record of my progress and showcase my coding abilities.

## üìÖ Daily Breakdown

Each day's work is organized into a dedicated folder (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`, etc.). Inside each folder, you'll find:

* A Python script (`.py`) with the day's code.
* A brief explanation of the problem or concept being addressed.

I invite you to follow along with my progress and see the evolution of my skills over the course of the month.
